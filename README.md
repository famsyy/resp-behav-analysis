CODE DESCRIPTION

This code is a work in progress for an analysis for an experiment I am running at Carleton University at the CANAL Lab (https://www.canallab.ca/).

The experiment in question explores the relationship between breathing and cognition. Participants perform a series of questionnaires (not included in this analysis pipeline) as well as breathing exercises and a working memory task. Primary outcomes of reaction time and accuracy are analyzed within this code.

Basic statistics (ANCOVA, ANOVA, various forms of T-tests, HSF, and Power) are explored in various ways. 

If you do notice any errors or inherent issues, I would appreciate being made aware of them - do not hesitate to reach out. Thank you<3
